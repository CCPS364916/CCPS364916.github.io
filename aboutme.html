    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In my personal and professional life I will be working toward being a cosmetologist. I have always been drawn to this industry and have known what I have wanted to pursue since I learned what the industry was.  To accomplish my goal, I will be starting a nail specialty course at a beauty school at the end of November 2023, and hopefully graduate in about 3 months. This will help me become licensed so I can start building my clientele. Then, once I graduate high school, I will take a cosmetology course to add more specialties under my belt. Having many different specialties can help in the long run whether its for building clientele or money. I also think its important to have values, I constantly think of determination, perseverance, and patience. I think its important to have these values when it comes to obtaining your dream. Some short term goals I have this year is to graduate as a licensed nail technician and get all A's throughout the school year. I want to be known as a hard worker and one of the best cosmetologists in the area.</p>
